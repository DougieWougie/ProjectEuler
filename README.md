# ProjectEuler
Solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) in a range of languages (R, Python and VB.Net).

Mostly not very elegant, I'm not a professional developer having completed a degree in 2018 but hopefully it shows improvement! Heck if it even gives you an idea or pointer it was worthwhile.

Individual problem thoughts and insights are on the [Wiki](https://github.com/DougieWougie/ProjectEuler/wiki).

## Being more Pythonic
Recently finished reading a couple of books and realise my code is often less than Pythonic, so I'm going through the solutions in Python and updating them. So far I've sorted the solution to problem 20.
